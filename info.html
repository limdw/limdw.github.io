                    During a manic episode, a person with bipolar disorder may feel extremely happy, energetic, and productive. They may also have racing thoughts, difficulty sleeping, and engage in risky or impulsive behavior.
                
                    During a depressive episode, a person with bipolar disorder may feel sad, hopeless, and have low energy. They may also have difficulty concentrating, changes in appetite and sleep patterns, and thoughts of death or suicide.
                    
                    Bipolar disorder is a chronic condition that requires long-term treatment, typically with a combination of medication and therapy. With proper treatment, it is possible to manage the symptoms of bipolar disorder and live a healthy and productive life.</p>

                Bipolar I disorder is defined by manic episodes that last at least 7 days (most of the 
                day, nearly every day) or by manic symptoms that are so severe that the person needs 
                immediate hospital care. Usually, depressive episodes occur as well, typically lasting 
                at least 2 weeks. Episodes of depression with mixed features (having depressive symptoms 
                and manic symptoms at the same time) are also possible. The experience of four or more 
                episodes of mania or depression within a year is termed “rapid cycling.”</p>

            <p class="fs-5">Bipolar disorder symptoms commonly improve with treatment. Medication is the cornerstone of bipolar disorder treatment, though talk therapy (psychotherapy) can help many patients learn about their illness and adhere to medications, preventing future mood episodes.
                <br>
                Medications known as “mood stabilizers” work too by correcting imbalanced brain signaling

    A diagnosis of bipolar II disorder requires someone to have at least one 
    major depressive episode and at least one hypomanic episode. 
    People return to their usual functioning between episodes. 
    People with bipolar II disorder often first seek treatment as a result of 
    their first depressive episode, since hypomanic episodes often feel pleasurable 
    and can even increase performance at work or school.
    <br>
    People with bipolar II disorder frequently have other mental illnesses such as 
    an anxiety disorder or substance use disorder, the latter of which can exacerbate 
    symptoms of depression or hypomania.

            <br>
            <p class="fs-5">
                Treatments for bipolar II are similar to those for bipolar I: medication and psychotherapy.
                 The most commonly used medications are mood stabilizers and antidepressants, depending on 
                 the specific symptoms. If depressive symptoms are severe and medication is not effective, 
                 ECT may be used. ECT involves several rounds of a brief electrical current applied to the scalp while the patient is under anesthesia, leading to a short, controlled seizure. ECT-induced seizures are believed to remodel brain signaling pathways.
        <br>
                 Each person's treatment is individualized as everyone is different.
